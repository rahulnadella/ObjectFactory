/* 
The class named ObjectFactory creates Swift class instances based on the class name.
It supports creating objects with either a parameterless initializer or an initializer 
that takes exactly one parameter. The class could easily be modified to support 
initializers with more parameters, if necessary.

There is a restriction that ObjectFactory imposes on the classes it can instantiate: 
they must derive (directly or indirectly) from NSObject. By default Swift classes 
do not derive from NSObject. There is no harm in making a Swift class derive from 
NSObject, though it might not always be possible based on a projectâ€™s specific 
class inheritance needs.
